ICE 0.8
-> I swear this time, fixed triple master recipe crafts
  -> "Turn in ASAP" now properly works, sorry bout that.
  -> Will look into a "per mission" basis in the future
  
ICE V0.0.0.9
FINALLY ACTUALLY SWEAR ON THE NAME OF CUTHULU'S NAME

Fixed the A-3 missions. 
-> this might in turn also help with the crafts that have been across multiple classes? Need to double check/please let me know
