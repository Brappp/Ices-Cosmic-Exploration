Ice's Cosmic Exploration (ICE) V 0.0.0.3
Small hotfix:
-> Fixed language issues across clients (french/german should now behave properly for missions)
-> Added the ability to delay between finishing a mission/abandoning and grabbing the next one.
-> Grabbing missions SHOULD now grab based off of ID, not by name. This should help prevent grabbing the wrong one (Thanks Liza for that)
