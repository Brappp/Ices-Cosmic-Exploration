Ice's Cosmic Exploration (ICE) V0.0.0.5
-> Went through and fixed all the mission items. Every recipe -should- be properly hooked up with the corresponding mission. 
    -> This also means that any x3 collectable crafts should also be up and running now. 
    -> This also should help stop the looping that would happen with certain missions as well. 
-> Cleaned up some memory leakage that might of happened over the course of several hours (thanks wah)
-> Missions will now show you what rewards they can give on the mission selection screen. 
-> Added the ability to checkmark/enable "turnin on silver && "Turnin ASAP" 
    -> this is off by default, but it's right there on the main window. You can't miss it. 
-> You can now start the plugin anytime during the process (pre-mission or post mission) and will now jump into the right part to do
-> There is some improvements to artisan interaction coming, but need to work on some things in the background first/get artisan code updated to meet the same specs (thank you Chika for this)
-> Added "stop" and "start" for commands. [This should of been added awhile back]

 THINGS TO STILL
-> Priority system 
-> Add gatherers as resetable 
    -> Then actually work on gatherers
